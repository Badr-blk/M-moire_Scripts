Holdings subject to change. See www.iShares.com for the most recent funds holdings.
The values for “price” shown herein generally represent a price provided by a third-party pricing vendor for the portfolio holding and do not reflect the impact of systematic fair valuation (“the vendor price”). The vendor price is not necessarily the price at which the Fund values the portfolio holding for the purposes of determining its net asset value (the “valuation price”). Additionally, where applicable, foreign currency exchange rates with respect to the portfolio holdings denominated in non-U.S. currencies for the valuation price will be generally determined as of the close of business on the New York Stock Exchange, whereas for the vendor price will be generally determined as of 4 p.m. London. The values shown herein for “market value,” “weight,” and “notional value” (the “calculated values”) are based off of the vendor price and may have been different if the valuation price were to have been used to calculate such values. The vendor price is as of the most recent practicable date and may not necessarily be as of the date shown above.
Please see the “Determination of Net Asset Value” section of each Fund’s prospectus for additional information on the Fund’s valuation policies and procedures.
